# FinCashApp

This full stack project is a multi-bank financial application that enables its users(individuals/business owners) to connect their various bank accounts form different banks or micro-finance banks and be able to track the transactions from the linked bank accounts all in one place.
The Application leverages the services of [Mono](https://mono.co/) which is a platform that makes available the middle-man per se that links the users bank and the application. It also has an extra feature of bill payments which uses the [Flutterwave](https://flutterwave.com/cm/) API for bulk payments of data and airtime.

Leveraging the ASP.NET Web API Library of the [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) framework for the backend, [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) for the User Interface and using many other npm and NuGet libraries, a full user interface and backend apis was created to handle the various functionalities in the web app.
